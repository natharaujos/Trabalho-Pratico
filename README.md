# Practical Work - Theory of Computation

- Group composed of:
  - Guilherme Da Costa Baesse
  - Nathan Ara√∫jo Silva

- Universal Turing Machine Implementation
- To run the tests, use the following command:

  __Python:__
  ```bash
  python program.py __argumento1__
  ```

- Each simulation execution is printed, and the implementation utilizes 3 tapes.
- At the end of the execution, a message is returned indicating whether the word was accepted or rejected, potentially entering a loop.
